# HHA504_assignment_functions
The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to serverless computing and the use of cron jobs in cloud environments. You will deploy serverless functions on both Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and create a scheduled task using GitHub Actions.

Azure Benefits
Azure Functions are cost-effective with a pay-per-execution model, charging only for resources during use. They autoscale based on demand and support rapid deployment in various programming languages like Python, Java, and C#. Developers can leverage integrated tools like Visual Studio and Azure Portal, with multiple plans available to suit different needs.

Azure Limitations
Azure Functions have a 10-minute execution limit on the consumption plan and offer limited memory and execution time, making them less ideal for long-running or resource-intensive tasks.

GCP Benefits
Google Cloud Functions offer a pay-per-use model with no infrastructure management costs, autoscaling to meet demand. They support fast deployment in languages like Node.js, Python, Go, and Java, and integrate seamlessly with GCP services like Pub/Sub and Cloud Storage.

GCP Limitations
Google Cloud Functions have a 9-minute execution limit and are restricted to 2 GB of memory, which can impact performance for more demanding tasks.
